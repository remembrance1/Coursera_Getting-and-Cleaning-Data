Getting and Cleaning Data (Coursera). Course Project Codebook
================

Introduction
------------

his repo contains my course project to Coursera ["Getting And Cleaning Data"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/home/welcome) course that is part of Data Science specialization.

There is just one script called run\_analysis.R. It contains all functions and code to do the following:

    1) Download UCI HAR zip file to data dir
    2) Read data
    3) Do some transformations
    4) Write output data to a CSV file inside data/output dir

The CodeBook.md explains it more detailed.
